Palo Alto Networks now provides templates to help you deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster in a Azure VNET. Traffic going in and out of the AKS clusters can be protected by the VM-Series firewalls. Security Policies can be applied on Kubernetes services for inbound traffic by leveraging Dynamic Address groups in Panorama. The solution works in conjunction with Azure AutoScaling feature which allows you to deploy an auto-scaling tier of VM-Series firewalls using several native Azure services. The template allows you to deploy the AKS cluster in one of the spoke VNET's in the auto scaling solution.
